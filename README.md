# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, patterns, relationships, and anomalies in a dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations.

## 🎯 Objective

Gain insights from the dataset using:
- Summary statistics
- Distributions
- Relationships between features
- Outlier detection
- Trend analysis

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – statistical plotting
- **Plotly** – interactive visualizations

---

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

### 1. Summary Statistics
- `.describe()` to compute **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, etc.
- `.info()` and `.isnull()` to check data types and missing values.

### 2. Visualizing Distributions
- **Histograms** for numeric features.
- **Boxplots** to detect outliers.

### 3. Feature Relationships
- **Seaborn Pairplot** to examine pairwise relations.
- **Correlation Matrix** with heatmap to identify linear correlations.

### 4. Pattern & Anomaly Detection
- Use **Plotly scatter plots** for trends and clustering.
- Spot outliers and skewed features.

### 5. Feature-Level Inferences
- Mean, median, and standard deviation printed per feature.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place your dataset file (e.g., `Titanic-Dataset.csv`) in the project folder.
2. Update the file name in the script if needed.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python task-2.py

Let me know if you'd like me to generate plots or summary statistics for a specific dataset like **Titanic**, **Iris**, or a custom file you upload.
